# Present Two Different UX Project Scenarios

This experiment involves the creation and documentation of two distinct UX project scenarios. Each scenario explores a different user problem, industry, and solution approach. The objective is to analyze, compare, and understand diverse UX challenges and design workflows.

---

## Objective

To practice UX research and planning by developing two contrasting project briefs that highlight different users, goals, and environments. Each scenario will include user personas, problem statements, goals, and proposed UX approaches.

---

## Aim

- To develop experience in framing UX projects for different industries or use cases.
- To demonstrate versatility in solving different types of user problems.
- To compare UX strategies, constraints, and solutions across two contexts.

---

## Scenario Requirements

Each UX project scenario should include:

1. **Title of the Project**
2. **Industry Domain (e.g., Education, Healthcare, E-commerce)**
3. **Problem Statement**
4. **Target Users and Personas**
5. **User Needs / Pain Points**
6. **UX Goals and Success Metrics**
7. **Proposed Features or Solutions**
8. **Workflow or User Journey Summary**
9. **Wireframe / Mockup (optional)**

---

## Procedure and Steps

1. **Choose Two Different Domains**
   - Example: Healthcare vs. Travel; E-commerce vs. Social Networking

2. **Define the Problem for Each**
   - Write a clear, user-centered problem statement.
   - Identify the primary user segment.

3. **Create Personas**
   - Develop at least one persona per scenario.
   - Include goals, frustrations, behaviors, and tech habits.

4. **Outline User Needs and UX Goals**
   - List what the user needs and what success looks like for each case.

5. **Propose a UX Solution**
   - Suggest relevant features or design approaches.

6. **Sketch User Journey or Workflow**
   - Diagram or describe how the user interacts with your proposed solution.

7. **Reflect and Compare**
   - Identify differences in UX challenges, tools, and strategies.
